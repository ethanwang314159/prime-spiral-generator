# Prime spiral generator

Generate unique **prime spirals** with Python by plotting prime numbers in a random colour map using polar coordinates.

## Description

**prime-spiral-generator** is an open project for generating images of **prime spirals** using Python and `matplotlib`.

It’s designed for both:

* **Non-programmers:** Just run `main.py` and 20 unique prime spirals will be generated automatically and saved in the `rand_images/` folder.
* **Programmers:** Tweak the settings or use the scripts in `gen_scripts/` to experiment with colours, density, markers, and more.

## Sample images

Sample outputs (from the included `rand_images/` folder):

| ![Sample 1](rand_images/1.png) | ![Sample 2](rand_images/8.png) | ![Sample 3](rand_images/11.png) |
| :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|        Random spiral #2        |        Random spiral #9        |        Random spiral #12        |

The repository includes 20 sample images (`0.png` through `19.png`) as examples of what the generator can produce.

## Installation

### Requirements

* **Python 3.10+**
* The following libraries:

  ```
  matplotlib
  numpy
  random
  math
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/prime-spiral-generator.git
   cd prime-spiral-generator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

   (`random` and `math` are part of Python’s standard library.)

---

## Usage

To generate 20 random prime spirals:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default:

* 20 images will be generated.
* Each image will use a random colour palette, marker style, and size.
* All images are saved automatically in the `rand_images/` folder.

From `main.py`:

```python
from gen_scripts.ps_plt_gen import gen_ps_plt
from gen_scripts.rand_settings_gen import gen_random_settings
from gen_scripts.next_fp_gen import gen_next_filepath
import os

REPEAT = 20
for i in range(REPEAT):
    FILEPATH = gen_next_filepath("rand_images")
    settings = gen_random_settings()
    plt = gen_ps_plt(settings)
    plt.savefig(FILEPATH, dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight', facecolor=settings[4])
```

You can change `REPEAT` to generate more or fewer images or adjust how randomisation works by editing the scripts inside `gen_scripts/`.

## Roadmap

Future ideas and planned improvements:

* **Animated spirals:** Smoothly grow or pulse the primes over time (maybe gifs).
* **Interactive GUI:** Adjust spiral parameters (colours, marker size, number of primes) in a good ui.
* **Custom config:** Allow saving and loading style presets.
